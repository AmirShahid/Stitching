# Medical Images Stitching

C++ implementation for Medical Image Stitching.

## Introduction

In the Automated Medical Image Scanning, we have a significant issue with the camera position in its path, thus the captured images is so likely to have overlapping fields with horizental and vertical adjacent images. My friends and I has developed a program in C++(due to its speed) which exports a DLL to be used in any project(I write a example for C#).

Overlapping Image Samples:
