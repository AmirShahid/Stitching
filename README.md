# Medical Images Stitching

C++ implementation for Medical Image Stitching.

## Introduction

In the Automated Medical Image Scanning, we have a significant issue with the camera position in its path, thus the captured images is so likely to have overlapping fields with horizental and vertical adjacent images. My friends and I has developed a program in C++(due to its speed) which exports a DLL to be used in any project(I write a example for C#).

Overlapping Image Samples:



## Requirements

* [OpenCV](https://github.com/opencv/opencv) 3.4.3
* [Xtensor](https://github.com/xtensor-stack/xtensor) 0.20.5

## Data 

We've made our own datasets from our Basler camera.

Examples:
